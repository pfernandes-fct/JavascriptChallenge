# Javascript Challenge

## Purpose and objective

Skills Workflow, as an organization, must make sure we hire resources that are not only knowledgeable but resourceful as well.
Here we propose a challenge to candidates for positions that involve the use of Javascript.

The main goal of this challenge is to assess the candidate's knowledge of Javascript, it's main concepts, idioms, project structure, etc. as well as to
assess how the candidate can think out of the box and use is knowledge to be proficient in new technology learning.

## Scope

- To address this challenge candidates must use Javascript, vanilla Javascript without the use of any additional library
- Any doubts or assumptions regarding the challenge must be documented to be discussed later
- Assume that you are a developer producing a reusable module / library for other developers to use on their own applications if needed

## The challenge

The challenge consists of producing a reusable module or library using Javascript.
When a developer includes this module or library on their application it should work without the need of any external Javascript library.

The purpose of this library is to render forms dynamically at runtime.

These forms should be defined in JSON and should be able to handle 3 kinds of controls:

- text input
- selection combo-box
- list

It is up to the candidate to design and implement this feature as well as design the required configuration JSON format.

### Output

The result of this challenge should be:

1. Project for the Javascript module/library
2. An Application (can be the same project from step 1) that uses the new module/library and serves as proof of concept.
